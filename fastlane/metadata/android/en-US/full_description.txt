**PlainApp** is a free, open-source Android app that turns your phone into a self-hosted management hub you can access from any web browser on the same network — no accounts, no cloud, no subscriptions. Whether you need to transfer files, read SMS, browse photos, or mirror your screen, PlainApp puts full control back in your hands.

## Why PlainApp?

Most phone-management tools either route your data through their own servers, lock features behind subscriptions, or plague you with ads. PlainApp is different:

- **100% local** — your data never leaves your network
- **End-to-end encrypted** — every connection is secured with TLS + XChaCha20-Poly1305
- **Completely free and ad-free** — no purchases, no upsells, ever
- **Fully open-source** — audit the code, build your own binary, or contribute

## Features

### 🌐 Web-Based Phone Management
Open a browser on any desktop or laptop connected to the same Wi-Fi network and get a full dashboard to manage your Android device — no app installation required on the computer side. Supports PWA so you can pin it to your desktop like a native app.

| Category | What you can do |
|---|---|
| **Files** | Browse internal storage, SD card, and USB drives; upload, download, rename, delete |
| **Media** | View and manage photos, videos, and audio; stream them directly in the browser |
| **Contacts** | View, search, and manage your contacts |
| **SMS & Calls** | Read messages and call logs; send SMS from your desktop |
| **Apps** | List installed apps and export APKs |
| **Notifications** | Mirror phone notifications to the browser in real time |
| **Screen Mirror** | Live-stream the phone screen to the browser with audio and remote control support |
| **Device Info** | Check battery, storage, network, and system details |

### 📱 Built-in Android Tools
PlainApp is also a capable standalone app — not just a server:

- **Markdown Notes** — write and organize notes with a clean editor
- **RSS Reader** — follow your favorite websites with a distraction-free reader
- **Video & Audio Player** — full-featured media player with playlist support
- **TV Cast** — cast media to any DLNA/Chromecast-compatible TV
- **Peer-to-Peer Chat & File Sharing** — share files and messages directly between devices without a server

### 🔒 Privacy & Security
- No Firebase Analytics or Messaging — crash reporting (via Firebase Crashlytics) is optional and opt-in

- All traffic between phone and browser is encrypted (TLS + XChaCha20-Poly1305)
